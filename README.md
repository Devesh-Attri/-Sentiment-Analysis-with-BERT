**#Adversarial Training and Defense Mechanisms for Sentiment Analysis**

**#Project Overview**

This project focuses on enhancing the robustness of a BERT-based sentiment analysis model against adversarial attacks. It involves training the model on the IMDB dataset and implementing both adversarial attacks and defense mechanisms using the TextAttack library.

**#Technologies Used**

• Language: Python
• Machine Learning Frameworks: PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers
• Adversarial Attacks & Defenses: TextAttack
• Development Environment: Jupyter Notebook
• Hardware: MacBook Air M1


**#Installation**

1) Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Devesh-Attri/-Sentiment-Analysis-with-BERT.git
cd {YOUR_FOLDER_NAME}

2) Create a virtual environment and activate it:
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

3) Install the required packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt


**#Usage**

1) Train the BERT model.
2) Run the training script.
3) Perform adversarial attacks:.
4) Run the adversarial attack script.
5) Implement defense mechanisms.
6) Run the defense mechanism script.

**#Project Structure**

• train_model.py: Script to train the BERT model on the IMDB dataset.
• adversarial_attack.py: Script to perform adversarial attacks using TextAttack.
• implement_defense.py: Script to implement defense mechanisms against adversarial attacks.
• requirements.txt: List of dependencies required to run the project.


**#Result**
The project aims to improve the robustness of sentiment analysis models by evaluating their performance under adversarial conditions and applying effective defense strategies.
